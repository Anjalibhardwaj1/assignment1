Despite the fact that all shapes are either Rectangle or Circle, you cannot pass
an a Shape[] array as Printable[] to the print method. Why?

The Shape interface extends NameObject so the collection Shape[] is not printable. But the elements of the collection are printable. 
The PrintableObject class extends the Printable interface which both the Rectangle and the Circle inherit from.
